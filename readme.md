Run `yarn && yarn present` to build the slides and start the presentation.
To do a rebuild on change run `yarn scribe:watch` in a second terminal.

For hints on how to edit the slides have a look at [asciidoctor-revealjs][adoc-reveal] and [asciidoc-syntax-quick-reference][quick].
There are a bunch of [examples](https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/tree/master/examples) that double as regression tests.

# Shortcuts
- `S` opens speaker notes  
- `B` blacks the screen
- `alt + click` zooms to the cursor location

# Todo
- push the rendered presentation to [github pages](https://signed.github.io/talk-template/)
- have a look at the new `@asciidoctor/cli` if it can simplify my setup
